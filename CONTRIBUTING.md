## Pull Requests

I am more than happy to review pull requests for features or bug fixes.
If your pull request involves a large change in Jetlog, please open an
issue about it before you spend a lot of time working on it.

## Bugs

If you spot erroneous behavior in Jetlog, feel free to open an issue about it.
Please make sure that you include any relevant information like logs, screenshots, etc.

## Features

If there is a feature that you would like to see added, make sure that someone has 
not requested it before (and if someone did, leave a thumbs up on that issue so I can track 
interest). Also please describe your use case for that feature, and be wary that I
would like to keep Jetlog focused on its function, so I may reject feature requests
that I deem to go out of the scope of the project.
